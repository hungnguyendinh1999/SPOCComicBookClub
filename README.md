## Getting started:
If anything, I find this tutorial here SUPER helpful for cloning projects!
https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository
Clone this Repository, make a branch, and start working
Remember to Commit and Push to your branch.


## Otherwise if you're getting a local copy of this:
Install npm and nodejs.

Install MongoDB and start the Database server.

Run `npm install` to update all dependencies.

Run `node db_initializer.js` to initialize collections and documents required for this project. DO NOT RUN IT TWICE.

Make sure that port `3000` is not occupied.

Finally, run `npm run start` or `node server.js` and go to http://localhost:3000/
